# STEWAGRAM

**STEWAGRAM** is the AI-assisted Antibiogram: Smart Technology for Enhanced Warning and Analysis of Growth and Resistance Antibiogram Monitoring. Version 0.3 now includes a failsafe mechanism for double-checking and reviewing transformer model results using named entity recognition (NER).

We are proud to announce the successful development and implementation of an automated, integrated framework for building hospital antibiogram, enhanced by artificial intelligence. This achievement represents a significant milestone in our efforts to streamline and improve healthcare outcomes.

This tool will:

    Remove manual data processing requirements
    Significantly speed up Antibiogram generation from raw Hospital Information System culture reports
